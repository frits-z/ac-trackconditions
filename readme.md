## Instructions

The app can be installed by pasting the content of the .zip file in the main root folder of Assetto Corsa, and must be enabled in the Assetto Corsa main menu. The size of the app can be tweaked in the config file.

## Functionality

The app provides the use with a live wind indicator. The indictator shows the wind direction relative to the direction the car is facing. The wind indicator is color-coded, showing green when the driver experiences headwind, yellow for a crosswind and red for a tailwind. A headwind produces more downforce and allows the driver to brake later and carry more speed through a corner.
